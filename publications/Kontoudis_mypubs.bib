  abstract = {Over the last decade underactuated, adaptive robot grippers and hands have received an increased interest from the robotics research community. This class of robotic end-effectors can be used in many different fields and scenarios with a very promising application being the development of prosthetic devices. Their suitability for the development of such devices is attributed to the utilization of underactuation that provides increased functionality and dexterity with reduced weight, cost, and control complexity. The most critical components of underactuated, adaptive hands that allow them to perform a broad set of grasp poses are appropriate differential mechanisms that facilitate the actuation of multiple degrees of freedom using a single motor. In this work, we focus on the design, analysis, and experimental validation of a four output geared differential, a series elastic differential, and a whiffletree differential that can incorporate a series of manual and automated locking mechanisms. The locking mechanisms have been developed so as to enhance the control of the differential outputs, allowing for efficient grasp selection with a minimal set of actuators. The differential mechanisms are applied to prosthetic hands, comparing them and describing the benefits and the disadvantages of each.},

  title = {Teaching Robotic and Biomechatronic Concepts with a Gripper Design Project and a Grasping and Manipulation Competition},
  author={Liarokapis, Minas and Kontoudis, George P},
  abstract = {Lecturers of Engineering courses around the world are struggling to increase the engagement of students through the introduction of appropriate hands-on activities and assignments. In Biomechatronics and Robotics courses these assignments typically focus on how certain devices are designed, modelled, fabricated, or controlled. The hardware for these assignments is usually purchased by some external vendor and the students only get the chance to analyze it or program it, so as to execute a useful task (e.g., programming mobile robots to perform path following tasks). Student engagement can be increased by instructing the students to prepare the hardware for their assignment. This also increases the sense of ownership of the project outcomes. In this paper, we present how a robotic gripper / hand design project and the introduction of a grasping and manipulation competition as a course assignment, can significantly increase the student engagement and their understanding of the taught concepts. The presented best practices have been trialed over the last four years in two different courses (one undergraduate and one postgraduate) of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. For the particular assignment the students were asked to fully develop a robotic gripper or hand from scratch using a single actuator (only the actuator and the power electronics were provided). The performance of the developed devices was assessed through the participation in a grasping and manipulation competition. All the details of the proposed assignment are presented, hoping that they could help other lecturers and teachers to prepare similar activities.},

  title={Combining Programming by Demonstration with Path Optimization and Local Replanning to Facilitate the Execution of Assembly Tasks},
  abstract = {With the emergence of agile manufacturing in highly automated industrial environments, the demand for efficient robot adaptation to dynamic task requirements is increasing. For assembly tasks in particular, classic robot programming methods tend to be rather time intensive. Thus, effectively responding to rapid production changes requires faster and more intuitive robot teaching approaches. This work focuses on combining programming by demonstration with path optimization and local replanning methods to allow for fast and intuitive programming of assembly tasks that requires minimal user expertise. Two demonstration approaches have been developed and integrated in the framework, one that relies on human to robot motion mapping (teleoperation based approach) and a kinesthetic teaching method. The two approaches have been compared with the classic, pendant based teaching. The framework optimizes the demonstrated robot trajectories with respect to the detected obstacle space and the provided task specifications and goals. The framework has also been designed to employ a local replanning scheme that adjusts the optimized robot path based on online feedback from the camera-based perception system, ensuring collision-free navigation and the execution of critical assembly motions. The efficiency of the methods has been validated through a series of experiments involving the execution of assembly tasks. Extensive comparisons of the different demonstration methods have been performed and the approaches have been evaluated in terms of teaching time, ease of use, and path length.},

  title={A Comparison of Kriging and Cokriging for Estimation of Underwater Acoustic Communication Performance},
  abstract = {Mobile underwater communication network nodes, such as autonomous underwater vehicles, can use estimates of underwater acoustic communication performance to anticipate where they are likely to be connected to the communication network. In this paper, we consider the challenge of estimating a spatial field that represents underwater acoustic communication performance from a set of measurements. Kriging, which is widely used in geostatistics, has been previously used to estimate the communication performance at unknown locations, by performing spatial extrapolation. We compare kriging to cokriging where the latter is a bivariate estimation method. The methodology yields estimates of communication performance at desired locations based on measurements acquired at other locations. Moreover, a variance measure is provided that characterizes the uncertainty of the estimation. We present the structure of the proposed estimation technique and its computational complexity. We evaluate the efficacy of the technique by considering an approximate linear-log model of the communication performance, environmental noise, and a direct comparison of kriging and cokriging results. We provide two sets of simulations in which the proposed multivariate cokriging framework outperforms the univariate kriging in the estimation process.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive robot hand that is capable of performing selective interdigitation, robust grasping, and dexterous, in-hand manipulation. The design consists of underactuated, compliant, anthropomorphic robot fingers that are implemented with flexure joints based on elastomer materials (urethane rubber). The metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of each finger can achieve both flexion/extension and abduction/adduction. The use of differential mechanisms simplifies the actuation scheme, as we utilize only two actuators for four fingers, achieving affordable dexterity. The two actuators offer increased power transmission during the execution of grasping and manipulation tasks. The importance of the thumb is highlighted with the use of two individual tendon-routing systems for its control. An analytical model is employed to derive the rotational stiffness of the finger flexure joints and select appropriate actuators. Selective interdigitation allows the robot hand to switch from pinch grasp configurations to power grasp configurations optimizing the performance of the device for specific objects. The design can be fabricated with off-the-shelf materials and rapid prototyping techniques, while its efficiency has been validated using an extensive set of experimental paradigms that involved the execution of complex tasks with everyday life objects.},

  title={An Adaptive Actuation Mechanism for Anthropomorphic Robot Hands},
  abstract = {This paper presents an adaptive actuation mechanism that can be employed for the development of anthropomorphic, dexterous robot hands. The tendon-driven actuation mechanism achieves both flexion/extension and adduction/abduction on the finger's metacarpophalangeal joint using two actuators. Moment arm pulleys are employed to drive the tendon laterally and achieve a simultaneous execution of abduction and flexion motion. Particular emphasis has been given to the modeling and analysis of the actuation mechanism. More specifically, the analysis determines specific values for the design parameters for desired abduction angles. Also, a model for spatial motion is provided that relates the actuation modes with the finger motions. A static balance analysis is performed for the computation of the tendon force at each joint. A model is employed for the computation of the stiffness of the rotational flexure joints. The proposed mechanism has been designed and fabricated with the hybrid deposition manufacturing technique. The efficiency of the mechanism has been validated with experiments that include the assessment of the role of friction, the computation of the reachable workspace, the assessment of the force exertion capabilities, the demonstration of the feasible motions, and the evaluation of the grasping and manipulation capabilities. An anthropomorphic robot hand equipped with the proposed actuation mechanism was also fabricated to evaluate its performance. The proposed mechanism facilitates the collaboration of actuators to increase the exerted forces, improving hand dexterity and allowing the execution of dexterous manipulation tasks.},

Moreover, a multiple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, is used to estimate the behavioral intention of social actors, in order to automate interventions for the improvement of actors' behavioral utility within the dynamic social network.
